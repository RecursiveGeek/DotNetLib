# Introduction
<img src="Images/network.png" width="64" align="right" alt="Daikin.DotNetLib.Network Logo"/>
This is a .NET Standard 2.0 library to support Web Apis (especially with Json), conversion of streaming data into objects (or vice-versa), and network calls.

# Getting Started
Use the library and take advantage of:

- WebAPI calls, including via Proxy (useful for debugging via Fiddler).
- JSON and XML WebAPI calls that automatically populate C# objects
- Setup HttpConnections and access via OAuth2.  
- SMTP Message Helper
- Provide standardized ContentTypes, avoiding the use of IIS to provide (which isn't always easily managed).
- Help Build URLs.
- Encode and Decode Base64 URLs.

# Samples
To see coding examples, check out the Unit Tests in [Daikin.DotNetLib.Core.Tests](..\Daikin.DotNetLib.Core.Tests\README.md) for examples on usage, especially `WebApiTests.cs`.
