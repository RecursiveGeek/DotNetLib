# Introduction
<img src="Images/application.png" width="64" align="right" alt="Daikin.DotNetLib.Application Logo"/>
This is a .NET Standard 2.0 library to provide generic application-specific support.

Due to the elimination of the method [ToRfc1123()](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/27986), which is required as part of .NET Core 2.1 libraries, the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.* NuGet packages are all at version 2.1.1 (rather than upgraded to the latest 5.0.0 at the time of this documentation update).

# Getting Started
Use the library and take advantage of:

- Assembly Name and Version Information
- Appsettings (and associated environments, usersecrets, environmental variable) configuration building
- File and Folder Pathing
- Status Result Management

# Documentation Overview
Check out the primary [README.md](../README.md) documentation.
