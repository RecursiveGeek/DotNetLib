# Introduction
<img src="Images/serial.png" width="64" align="right" alt="RecursiveGeek.DotNetLib.Serial Logo"/>
This is a .NET Framework 4.5 library to support Winforms and WPF development efforts.

While currently using an older .NET Framework Library, for maximum reach, the older library is used until there is a need to upgrade.  This allows maximum coverage of hosting providers, many of which still don't support the latest version or do so with additional fees.

# Getting Started
Use the library to access helpers in the following areas (and presumes a strong understanding in these areas):

- USB Helpers
- Serial Port Helpers

# Documentation Overview
Check out the primary [README.md](../README.md) documentation.
